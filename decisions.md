### Missing data handling

- For missing values in `review`, we will fill them with the string `NoReviewProvided`
- We have to check the rating score of each row that doesn't have a review.

### Temporal analysis of recipes
- We will analyze the `date` column to identify any trends or patterns in recipe submissions over time.
